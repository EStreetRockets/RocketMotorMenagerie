		#LOC_rmm_arenysaurus_title = RM-4LR-35 'Arenysaurus' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_arenysaurus_description = The 'Arenysaurus' is what you need for boosters that need something even more powerful than the 'Kilimanjaro'. Utilizing methalox propellants and a 35:1 expansion nozzle, this engine is well-suited for liquid rocket boosters that need a great balance of high thrust and high ISP.

		#LOC_rmm_arsia_title = RM-25-TDI 'Arsia' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_arsia_description = The 'Arsia' is really, really, REALLY big. After all, its got a 1:800 expansion ratio. Derived from the 'Cotopaxi', it was built for use on Duna Transfer Vehicles to for the Duna Transfer Injection burn.

		#LOC_rmm_ceraunius_title = RM-25-150 'Ceraunius' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_ceraunius_description = Derived from the 'Cotopaxi', the 'Ceraunius' was developed for an allegedly rushed upper stage engine. 'Ceraunius' is just that engine. It is based on the venerable 'Cotopaxi' but uses a nozzle with a 150:1 expansion area ratio. Due to some technical heritage from the 'Cotopaxi', it needs to be kept cold if to restart it on-orbit, so it comes with an orbital variant painted white to reflect the heat. Also includes foil mounting options.

		#LOC_rmm_cotopaxi_title = RM-25-69 'Cotopaxi' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_cotopaxi_description = After years of trials and tribulations, the 'Cotopaxi' is ready to fly as part of a grander vision to make space affordable and accessible, and power Kerbal Kind towards a future in the stars. Derived from previous work on hydrolox engines, this beast is a modern take on some of the most iconic powerhouses of space exploration. Combining efficient hydrolox fuels, a stellar gimbal range and advanced tooling and machinery, this powerful engine will have a place among the greats of rocketry.

		#LOC_rmm_dugong_title = RM-S6B-35 'Dugong' Liquid Fuel Engine
		#LOC_rmm_dugong_description = The 'Dugong' is the result of modifying a 'Cotopaxi' to use Liquid Fuel and then sticking a 1:35 expansion nozzle on the flamey end. (Yeah, you read that right.) It can be used on liquid rocket boosters or on dual-mode SSTOs, where it can provide high thrust early in flight. It was hard to fit the new coolant and Liquid Fuel turbopumps onto the engine, so it can only gimble in one plane. Best used in clusters.

		#LOC_rmm_ishtar_title = RM-25-50X 'Ishtar' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_ishtar_description = The 'Ishtar' is a modified 'Cotopaxi' with a two-position retractable nozzle. It has a fixed nozzle with a 1:50 expansion area ratio and the retractable portion increases that expansion to 1:150. This makes it a fairly wacky engine, best suited for SSTO vehicles. \n<#CD7600>AUTHOR'S NOTE: The engine can be used with its two position nozzle either retracted for optimal sea level performance or deployed for optimal altitude or vacuum performance. This switch can be made in flight using the mode switch via the right click part action window or an action group.</color>

		#LOC_rmm_kilimanjaro_title = RM-25-35 'Kilimanjaro' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_kilimanjaro_description = Based on the 'Cotopaxi', this has a nozzle with a 35:1 expansion area ratio. This modification produces an engine with improved performance and thrust at lower altitudes, making it well suited for booster applications.

		#LOC_rmm_osorno_title = RM-25-50 'Osorno' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_osorno_description = The 'Osorno', with its 50:1 expansion area ratio nozzle, occupies that space in between the 'Cotopaxi' and the 'Kilimanjaro'. It is a very versatile engine that can be used for a variety of first-stage applications.

		#LOC_rmm_rainier_title = RM-122T 'Rainier' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_rainier_description = Based on heritage technologies from the venerable 'Cotopaxi', this powerful sustainer engine is designed for low cost and high reliability when used on a wide variety of launch vehicles. Cassiopeia Propulsion Systems is certain it has a bright future with many decades of use as it propels space exploration to reach new achievements. Comes with nozzle variants for better performance as a booster, sustainer, or high altitude engine.

		#LOC_rmm_turiasaurus_title = RM-13SE 'Turiasaurus' Cryogenic Rocket Engine
		#LOC_rmm_turiasaurus_description = The 'Turiasaurus' is highly reliable, low cost booster engine that uses an innovative methalox split expander cycle. It is intended for use on reusable vehicles, but it's cheap enough that you can put it on an expendable vehicle as well.
